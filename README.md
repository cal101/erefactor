## TL;DR

Erefactor is an eclipse based "Continuous Maintenance" tool that integrates into
git merge/pull request based web workflows and delivers automatic java code cleanups
(hopefully) ready for review and integration.

## Motivation

Tools like the great AutoRefactor eclipse plugin (https://github.com/JnRouvignac/AutoRefactor)
or modern IDEs in general offer a lot of cleanups. They can be executed on demand or may be executed
automatically on code save.

Cleanups start with formatting but also includes cleanups for removing useless stuff, following
good practices or migrating away from deprecated features.

So less manual work to be done to get better code easily.

But unfortunately tools like AutoRefactor don't get the attention and credit they deserve.
AutoRefactor is an impressive tool and was initially created by Jean-NoÃ«l Rouvignac and is now mostly
developed by Fabrice Tiercelin.

So why not combine these tools with modern CI/CD practices and tools and provide
cleanups right to the development workflow as merge/pull requests.

Erefactor tries to help with this.

But note that the tools have bugs and even by avoiding a null pointer exception
the software behavior may change in unexpected ways.

Therefore manual review is highly recommended.

## Technical

Erefactor is an eclipse application that applies cleanups/refactorings supplied by some *Provider*.

Currently only one provider is available, more are planned.

Please use the issues for questions or suggestions.

Available cleanups/refactorings:

```
    AddAllRatherThanLoopCleanUp - Collections.addAll() rather than loop (pre-configured)
        Collection related refactorings:
        - replaces for/foreach loops to use Collections.addAll() where 
        possible,
        - replaces for/foreach loops to use Collection.addAll() where 
        possible,
        - replaces for/foreach loops to use Collection.removeAll() where 
        possible.
    AddBracketsToControlStatementCleanUp - Add brackets to control statement (pre-configured)
        Adds brackets to:
        - if then/else clauses,
        - for loop body,
        - do ... while loop body,
        - while loop body.
    AggregateConstructorRatherThanGWTMethodCleanUp - Aggregate constructor rather than GWT method (pre-configured)
        Use new ArrayList<>() and new HashMap<>() instead of using specific 
        GWT Lists.newArrayList() and Maps.newHashMap().
    AndConditionRatherThanEmbededIfCleanUp - Collapse if statements (pre-configured)
        Merge inside if statement into the parent if statement.
    AndroidViewHolderCleanUp - Android ViewHolder (pre-configured)
        Android - Optimize getView() routines for Android applications. It 
        reduces the number calls to the costly inflate()) and getViewById() 
        Android API methods.
    AndroidWakeLockCleanUp - Android WakeLock (pre-configured)
        Android - Failing to release a wakelock properly can keep the 
        Android device in a high power mode, which reduces battery life. 
        There are several causes for this, such as releasing the wake lock 
        in onDestroy() instead of in onPause(), failing to call release() in 
        all possible code paths after an acquire(), and so on.
    AnnotationCleanUp - Annotation (pre-configured)
        Simplifies annotation uses:
        - empty parentheses will be removed from annotations,

        Removes useless bad value checks before assignments or return 
        statements.
        Such useless bad value checks are comparing an expression against 
        bad value,
        then either assigning bad value or the expression depending on the 
        result of the bad value check.
        It is simpler to directly assign the expression.
    AssignRatherThanTernaryFilterThenAssignAnywayCleanUp - Assign rather than ternary filter then assign anyway
      (pre-configured)
        Removes useless bad value checks before assignments or return 
        statements.
        Such useless bad value checks are comparing an expression against 
        bad value,
        then either assigning bad value or the expression depending on the 
        result of the bad value check.
        It is simpler to directly assign the expression.

        with opposite boolean values,
        - remove ternary operators when then and else clauses do similar 
        things with opposite boolean values,
        - simplify boolean expressions.

        - remove calls to String.toString() inside String concatenations,
        - replace useless case shifts for equality by equalsIgnoreCase()
        Refactors:

        Removes a String instance from a String literal.
    StringValueOfRatherThanConcatCleanUp - String.valueOf() rather than concatenation (pre-configured)

        class.
    SwitchCleanUp - Switch (pre-configured)
        Switch related refactorings:
        - replaces if/else if/else blocks to use switch where possible.
    TernaryOperatorRatherThanDuplicateConditionsCleanUp - Ternary operator rather than duplicate conditions (pre-configured)
        Replace (X && Y) || (!X && Z) by X ? Y : Z.
    TestNGAssertCleanUp - TestNG asserts (pre-configured)
        Refactors to a proper use of TestNG assertions.

        their parameter to truncate strings
    TryWithResourceCleanUp - Use try-with-resource (pre-configured)
        Changes code to make use of Java 7 try-with-resources feature. In 
        particular, it removes now useless finally clauses.

        Remove useless primitiveValue() call to use unboxing.
    UpdateSetRatherThanTestingFirstCleanUp - Update set rather than testing first (pre-configured)
        Set related refactorings:
        - replaces calls to Set.contains() immediately followed by Set.add() 
        with straight calls to Set.add(),
        - replaces calls to Set.contains() immediately followed by Set.
        remove() with straight calls to Set.remove(). Beware! It may change 
        the behavior if you use custom Set implementation!
    UppercaseNumberSuffixRatherThanLowercaseCleanUp - Capitalize lower case 'l' -> 'L' for long
      'f' -> 'F' for float number literals (pre-configured)
        Capitalize lower case 'l' -> 'L' for long 'f' -> 'F' for float 
        number literals.
    UseDiamondOperatorCleanUp - Diamond operator (pre-configured)
        Refactors class instance creations to use the diamond operator 
        wherever possible.
    UseMultiCatchCleanUp - Multi-catch (pre-configured)

        catch.
    UseStringContainsCleanUp - Use String.contains() (pre-configured)
        Replaces uses of String.indexOf(String) String.lastIndexOf(String) 
        by String.contains(CharSequence) where appropriate.
    ValueOfRatherThanInstantiationCleanUp - valueOf() rather than instantiation (pre-configured)
        Replaces unnecessary primitive wrappers instance creations by using 
        static factory methods ("valueOf()").
    VariableInsideIfRatherThanAboveCleanUp - Variable inside if rather than above (pre-configured)
        Move a variable assignment that is only used in an if inside the if 
        clause.
    VectorOldToNewAPICleanUp - Collections APIs rather than Vector pre-Collections APIs (pre-configured)
        Replaces Vector pre-Collections APIs with equivalent Collections 
        APIs.
    WhileConditionRatherThanInnerIfCleanUp - While condition rather than inner if (pre-configured)
        Move a condition of an inner if that breaks a while loop into the 
        while condition.
    XORRatherThanDuplicateConditionsCleanUp - XOR rather than duplicate conditions (pre-configured)
        Replace (X && !Y) || (!X && Y) by X ^ Y.
```

Note that the cleanups have different levels of usefulness and maturity.

Manual review is higly recommended.

Note also that some refactorings need a final formatting step which should be provided by the target project.
